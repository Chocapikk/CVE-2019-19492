# FreeSWITCH Exploit (CVE-2019-19492)

Exploit script for FreeSWITCH by Chocapikk and TrHacknon.

## Description

This script allows you to exploit FreeSWITCH vulnerabilities by executing remote commands. It supports exploitation of a single specified target or automatic generation of a list of targets from Shodan.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- shodan library (installed with `pip install shodan`)
- `rich` library (installed with `pip install rich`)
- `prompt_toolkit` library (installed with `pip install prompt_toolkit`)

## Usage

```
python exploit.py [--target IP] [--auto] [--output FILE]
```

Options:
- `--target IP`: Specifies a single IP target to exploit.
- `--auto`: Automatically generates a list of targets from Shodan.
- `--output FILE`: Specifies the output file for vulnerable targets (default: `vulnerable.txt`).

If you specify `--target IP`, the script will check the target for vulnerability and open an interactive shell to execute remote commands.

If you use `--auto`, the script will automatically generate a list of targets from Shodan and exploit each target to execute the specified command.

## Notes

- Make sure you have set your Shodan API key as the `SHODAN_API_KEY` environment variable.
- When using the interactive shell, you can enter commands to be executed remotely.
- When you exit the interactive shell, the script will display "Exited shell, deleting" and remove the contents of the output file from the vulnerable targets.
